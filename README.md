# Music Mood Classifier
A project that explores the classification of songs from Spotify into moods through classification models and a neural network. We target the following four categories - happy, sad, calm and stressful - to ultimately distinguish stressful music from others to provide a relaxing listening experience to people suffering from anxiety and distress.

The file `spotify.py` uses the Spotify API to compile audio features of 260 songs and generate our dataset, `dataset.csv`.
The file `mood-classifier.ipynb` contains the classification models for the support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and naive bayes. <br />
The file `dl-mood-classifier.ipynb` contains the deep learning classification model, using neural networks.
